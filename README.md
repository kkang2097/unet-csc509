# unet-csc509

- Implementation of U-Net (credits in /models/unet.py)
- wrote DataLoader mostly from scratch


Improvements over Colab Notebook:
- takes 15 seconds, not 15 minutes to load dataset
- vectorized, modular code for inference w/U-Net

#### Step 1: Pre-processing in Jupyter Notebook, written from scratch mostly 
**done**
#### Step 2: Write DataLoader (so we get 'X' and 'Y' easily)
**done**

#### Step 3: Use U-Net PyTorch
**done**

#### Step 4: Write new model
