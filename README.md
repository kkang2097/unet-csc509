# unet-csc509

- Trying to write a custom implementation of U-Net in PyTorch
- idea: Use stochastic weight averaging (SWA) to improve loss

#### Step 1: Pre-processing in Jupyter Notebook, written from scratch mostly 
**done**
#### Step 2: Write DataLoader (so we get 'X' and 'Y' easily)
**done**
#### Step 3: Write U-Net model
#### Step 4: Measure loss, etc.
